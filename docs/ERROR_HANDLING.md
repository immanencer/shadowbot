# Error Handling and Logging

## Overview

This document provides guidelines and instructions for error handling and logging within the project. Proper error handling and logging are crucial for troubleshooting and maintaining the stability of the application.

## Error Handling

### General Principles

1. **Catch and Handle Errors**: Always catch and handle errors gracefully. Avoid letting errors propagate without proper handling.
2. **Provide Meaningful Messages**: When catching errors, provide meaningful error messages that can help in diagnosing the issue.
3. **Fail Fast**: In critical sections of the code, fail fast and provide clear error messages to avoid cascading failures.
4. **Use Custom Error Classes**: Define and use custom error classes for specific error scenarios to provide more context.

### Example

```javascript
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
  // Handle the error appropriately
}
```

## Logging

### General Principles

1. **Log at Appropriate Levels**: Use appropriate logging levels (e.g., info, warn, error) to categorize log messages.
2. **Include Contextual Information**: Include relevant contextual information in log messages to aid in troubleshooting.
3. **Avoid Sensitive Information**: Do not log sensitive information such as passwords or personal data.
4. **Use a Logging Library**: Utilize a logging library (e.g., Winston) to manage log messages and output them to different destinations (e.g., console, files).

### Example

```javascript
import winston from 'winston';

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'app.log' })
  ],
});

logger.info('Application started');
logger.warn('This is a warning message');
logger.error('An error occurred');
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Database Connection Errors

1. **Check Connection String**: Ensure that the database connection string is correct and the database server is running.
2. **Network Issues**: Verify that there are no network issues preventing the application from connecting to the database.
3. **Authentication**: Ensure that the database credentials are correct and have the necessary permissions.

### API Errors

1. **Check API Endpoint**: Verify that the API endpoint is correct and the server is reachable.
2. **API Key**: Ensure that the API key is valid and has the necessary permissions.
3. **Rate Limits**: Check if the API rate limits have been exceeded and handle rate limit errors appropriately.

### File System Errors

1. **File Permissions**: Ensure that the application has the necessary permissions to read/write files.
2. **File Paths**: Verify that the file paths are correct and the files exist.
3. **Disk Space**: Check if there is sufficient disk space available for file operations.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines for error handling and logging, you can improve the reliability and maintainability of the application. Proper error handling and logging are essential for identifying and resolving issues efficiently.
